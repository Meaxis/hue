# Hue
## The worst video player.

Hue is a video player made to be bad. It's part of an experiment I wanted to do. 

Controls:
[i] (when selecting video) -> show .info file matching video
[enter] (when selecting video) -> play video // (when selecting popup) -> close popup
[escape] (when playing video) -> close video // (when selecting popup) -> close popup
[s] scaling mode = stretch
[f] scaling mode = fit
[e] test if pop-ups work
