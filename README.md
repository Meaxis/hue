# Hue
## The worst video player.

Hue is a video player made to be bad. It's part of an experiment I wanted to do. 

Controls:<br><br>
[i] (when selecting video) -> show .info file matching video<br>
[enter] (when selecting video) -> play video // (when selecting popup) -> close popup<br>
[escape] (when playing video) -> close video // (when selecting popup) -> close popup<br>
[s] scaling mode = stretch<br>
[f] scaling mode = fit<br>
[e] test if pop-ups work<br>
